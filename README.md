Scripts I use in the game bitburner

I play this game through steam. And it is a perfect way to hone your javascript skills. Not the best way to get started with Javascript, but it is a great tool to pick up after you learned the basics through codeacademy or a another platform.

I really like to your challenged to build your freeform applications in a less guided form than most of the tutorials are on code academy. And it helps that you can play like you are an hacker. Feels super cool.
